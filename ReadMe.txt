I am starting this assignment, and it took a little while to get warcio from the benchmark/go.py as I needed to install pycharm. I had different software to work on python with.

I do not believe I can get far in the project, as I have no idea what I am doing. I am still a Sophomore in college so I have not had experience working with software that gets information from online, but I will try my best. 

I have run into an error with the code you have given me copy from github, running it as it is. I included the error in the source files and I am stuck here. I have never worked with archiveIterator(warcio) before and when I first try and start this code I was given, I have an error so I am lost on what to do. I do not believe I can accomplish much on this assignment because I can not get the started code working. If I can not understand how to work with paths, then I will never be able to do much progress on that at all. 

Thanks for this opportunity, it just seems like I need experience in fetching information online as I have no experience in this area and will get easily lost.
